# ChatGPT o1-preview grid game

ChatGPT o1-preview was able to generate this game with only nine prompts. Several of the prompts were fairly complex, and it only made one mistake, which it fixed correctly without me having to guide it very much. It was even able to self-referentially include the prompts I gave it verbatim. Impressive stuff!
